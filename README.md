# EPROM-Character-Selector-for-Sharp-MZ-700
EPROM Selector Europe or Japan characters

Project: EPROM selector Europe or Japan

Having found only 2 character EPROMs for the Sharp MZ-700,
I decided to replace the original EPROM 2732
by a 2764 containing all the character fonts
European and Japanese.

The selection is done manually with an inverter.

I used the following material:

- 2 BKL Electronic PCB Connector 10120884
     Nbr total of poles 24 Nbr of rows 2
     n Â° 741949

  - 1 flat cable of 24 conductors (recovery)
  - 1 PCB (homemade): see PCB file
  - 1 inverter (homemade)
  - 2 decoupling capacitors of 100pF

I put some pictures to see the result with
European characters and with Japanese characters.

The /roms/MZ700_polices_2764.rom file contains the 2 fonts
characters.
